# R3

‚Ñù<sup>3</sup> denotes Three-Dimensional Space in maths, and now is a demo tool allows you to draw in 3D space. It's inspired by an Android Experiment [InkSpace](https://www.androidexperiments.com/experiment/ink-space) and [SwiftSpace](http://flexmonkey.blogspot.com/2015/08/coremotion-controlled-3d-sketching-on.html). R3 is actual  an Objective-C alternative to SwiftSpace which gives me a great chance to learn the new features of Swift and get familiar with [SceneKit](https://developer.apple.com/library/ios/documentation/SceneKit/Reference/SceneKit_Framework/) Framework.
